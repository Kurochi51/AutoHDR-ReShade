# AutoHDR
AutoHDR addon and effect for ReShade 5.9.2

To install add a ReShade add on path that points to the root of this repository on your local hard disk.  Alternatively copy AutoHDR.fx, AutoHDR32.addon and AutoHDR64.addon to a ReShade add on path location.

You will also need to add a ReShade effect search path to the root of this repository on your local hard disk.

Once done you can enable HDR under the add on tab of ReShade and then be sure to either select AutoHDR.fx OR if installed SonyMegatron.fx.

This add on is ideally intended to be used with the Sony Megatron CRT shader which can be found alongside this repository on my GitHub page.
